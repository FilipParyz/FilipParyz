### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a developer who likes to fiddle with hardware. It started with blinking LEDs using Arduino, and now I work on industrial projects insuring safety and reliability, while caring for the top class performance. Aside from my work, I study part-time to achieve Higher Education. In my free time, I'm brewing a cup of specialty coffee and improve on my ergonomics using a 3D printed mechanical keyboard which is running a modified open source firmware.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my mechanical keyboard running QMK (https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, Python
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with bigger projects, understanding the foundations.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about coffee, programmable mechanical keyboards and rubiks cubes!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: by mail at paryz.filip@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've competed in and organised a few Rubiks Cube competitions in Poland.
