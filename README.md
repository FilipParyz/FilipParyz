### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a developer with passion for hardware. It started with Arduino and now I work on industrial 3D Printers, to allow companies realise their projects with ease.
Aside from my work I study part-time to become an Engineer.
In my free time I'm improving my ergonomics by creating my 3D printed mechanical keyboard running modified open source firmware, while drinking speciality coffee.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my mechanical keyboard running QMK (https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with bigger projects, understanding the foundations.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about coffee, programmable mechanical keyboards and rubiks cubes!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: by mail at paryzfilip@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've competed in and organised a few Rubiks Cube competitions in Poland.
